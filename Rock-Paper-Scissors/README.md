# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, and a pair of scissors. 
The winner is determines according to a set of rules.

## Summary of the code
A simple version of this game has been created with python. 
In this version, one player will be controlled by the computer and the other, by the user.

## Instructions
1. Create a new Python file and call it main.py. Inside it you'll create your game.
2. Create a list to store all possible options:
  "R" for "rock", 
  "P" for "paper", 
  "S" for "scissors".
3. When the program is run, ask the user to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S"
4. If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), print an error, and ask for their input again (should be a loop)
5. Use the `choice` function from the inbuilt Python `random` module to make a choice for CPU player(computer).
6. Print both player's moves in the format: `Player (Rock) : CPU (Paper)`
7. Check both player's moves: 
8. If there is a winner, print the winner, and the program ends. 
9. If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move), restart the game from step 3
